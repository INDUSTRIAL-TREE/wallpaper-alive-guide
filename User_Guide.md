## Finding Wallpapers
To find interesting wallpapers for your desktop try the following:
1. Wallpaper Alive is compatible with the 600,000+ **VIDEO TYPE** wallpapers on the [Wallpaper Engine Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=431960&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems).
To install you will have to go to the workshop and save the link for a **video type** wallpaper that you like (Select video when filtering by type). You can download
these wallpapers using these 3rd party tools: https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/, http://steamworkshop.download/.  
NOTE: That these services may not always work and you will likely have greater success installing more popular files.  

2. [My Live Wallpapers](https://mylivewallpapers.com/) is a free library of 3,000+ animated wallpapers similar to those found on the Wallpaper Engine Workshop.
